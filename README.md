# Emotion-Detection-FER-2013

About dataset :
---------------

FER-2013 from kaggle.
This class has imbalance which was addressed using image augmentation and class weights

Architectures used :
--------------------
1] CNN from Scratch
2] CNN model using image augmentation
3] VGG16 using transfer learning
4] ResNet50 using transfer learning

Future plan :
-------------
1] Serve it using Gradio and HuggingFace Spaces
2] Also convert this notebook to PyTorch (for practise purpose)
3] Try out other architectures to improve performance
